- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheEnigmaticShadow
- 👀 I’m interested in Retro consoles and gaming and Minecraft Modded (FTB)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic level programming in C++, Javascript (Minecraft related), 6502 Machine coding and Z80 Machine Coding
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on at the moment just feeling my way around GitHub. Too newbie to collaborate yet (he says modestly) ;)
- 📫 How to reach me - via my email at the moment, still setting up public social media links ;)
